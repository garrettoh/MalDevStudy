# NTAPI Shellcode Injection

I'm using this to learn about NTAPI and how I can utilize the lower level API calls for malware development

**THIS IS NOT MY CODE** this is crows code i plan to add my own implementation i just followed along to get a better understanding

pinject is just basic process injection using VirtualAlloc and CreateRemoteThread wheras NTAPIInjection is using the lower level API
